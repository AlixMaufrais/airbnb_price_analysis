# Airbnb price analysis

In this notebook, we will work on Airbnb data.

The objective will be to load the data, clean and format it, before exploring and analyzing it.

As a Data Analyst I will try to answer the following problems:    
 
* Is the average price difference between "entire home" and "private room" properties significant?
* Does a host's response time affect its final review score?
* Price trend analysis: are hosts taking advantage of the calendar to set their prices?
